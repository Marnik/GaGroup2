# GaGroup2

Group Project regarding the optimisation of a genetic algorithm. The algorithm simulates the picture of Mona Lisa using 
100 overlapping triangles.
These triangls have different values for the x/y positions(6 values per triangle) of their corners and rgba values for 
their color (4 values per triangle).
The project was about improving the result of the algorithm after 2000 generations compared to the baseline genetic algorithm.
